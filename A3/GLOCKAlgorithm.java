 * This policy is the generalised version of the Clock policy introduced in the lecture. The frames are considered as circular buffer and
 * initially the Clock pointer is set to indicate the first frame (as in the simple Clock policy). Each frame has a reference counter
 * (instead of a reference bit as in simple Clock) initialized to zero. When a page is loaded the reference counter of that frames is set to
 * zero and after the first reference to that page the reference counter is set to 1 and the clock pointer is incremented to point to the next frame.
 * Whenever the page is subsequently referenced the reference counter is incremented by one. The replacement procedure for GCLOCK works similar to Clock policy.
 * For replacement the GCLOCK scans through the buffer from the pointerâ€™s current position looking for a reference counter with value zero. If the counter
 * is not zero it is decremented by one and the pointer moves to the next frame. When a frame with reference counter zero is found its current page is replaced
 * with the new page and the pointer is set to the next frame.
